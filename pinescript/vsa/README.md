# Wyckoff

The **Wyckoff Method** is a well-known framework for understanding and trading financial markets, especially used in technical analysis to identify accumulation and distribution phases by large institutional players ("smart money"). It was developed by **Richard D. Wyckoff** in the early 1900s and is widely applied in stocks, crypto, and forex markets.


## üß† Core Concepts of the Wyckoff Method

### 1. **Three Laws**

* **The Law of Supply and Demand**: Price moves up when demand exceeds supply and down when supply exceeds demand.
* **The Law of Cause and Effect**: The preparation (accumulation/distribution) determines the magnitude of the move (effect).
* **The Law of Effort vs. Result**: Compares volume (effort) with price action (result) to assess the strength or weakness behind a move.

## üìä Wyckoff Price Cycle Phases

### **A. Accumulation Phase**

* Smart money is **buying** while the general public is selling.
* Price forms a **range-bound structure**.
* Ends with a **spring** or shakeout (false breakdown) before a mark-up.

### **B. Mark-Up Phase**

* Clear **uptrend** begins.
* Breakout above the trading range.
* Public starts buying; smart money begins to offload positions gradually.

### **C. Distribution Phase**

* Smart money is **selling** while public is buying the rally.
* Price moves in a **sideways** range again.
* Ends with an **upthrust** (false breakout) before a mark-down.

### **D. Mark-Down Phase**

* Clear **downtrend** begins.
* Panic selling occurs.
* Cycle may restart with a new accumulation.


## üîç Schematics

### **Accumulation Schematic Example**

* PS = Preliminary Support
* SC = Selling Climax
* AR = Automatic Rally
* ST = Secondary Test
* Spring = Final shakeout
* SOS = Sign of Strength
* LPS = Last Point of Support

### **Distribution Schematic Example**

* PSY = Preliminary Supply
* BC = Buying Climax
* AR = Automatic Reaction
* ST = Secondary Test
* UT = Upthrust
* SOW = Sign of Weakness
* LPSY = Last Point of Supply

## üìà How Traders Use Wyckoff

1. **Identify the Phase** (accumulation or distribution)
2. **Label Key Events** (SC, ST, SOS, etc.)
3. **Confirm with Volume** and Price Spread
4. **Enter** after confirmation (e.g., after Spring or Upthrust)
5. **Exit** near SOW or signs of trend reversal
