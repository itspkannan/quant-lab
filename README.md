# Quant‑Strategy‑Lab

🧠 **Quant-Strategy-Lab** is a research-oriented workspace designed to explore, analyze, and document quantitative trading strategies, macroeconomic factors, and PineScript-based signal systems.

## 🧾 Current Focus

* ✅ Documentation of market anomalies like the **January Effect** and **VIX behavior**
* ✅ Historical study on ETFs like **UVXY**
* ✅ Impact of geopolitical and policy news on markets
* ✅ Collection of **PineScript** indicators and strategies, including **Volume Spread Analysis (VSA)**

## 🚀 Getting Started

Although this repo does not yet include executable Python strategy code or a backtesting engine, it's a strong starting point for:

1. Studying historical edge cases
2. Translating visual PineScript ideas into Python
3. Annotating trading observations and seasonal effects

### Suggested Usage

* Open and read through the markdown files in `notes/`
* Browse `pinescript/` for technical indicator ideas
* Use the structure in `project-work/` to begin implementing your own strategies


## 📌 TODO (Coming Soon)

Add these items as the project evolves:

* [ ] Build a modular backtest engine using Python
* [ ] Import OHLCV data and fundamental data loaders
* [ ] Integrate backtest results with Jupyter notebooks
* [ ] Develop execution models (slippage, fees, leverage)
* [ ] Parameter tuning and optimization engine
* [ ] Live trading hooks via Alpaca / Interactive Brokers
