# 📚 Finance Study

Python applications built to support my master's program and explore quantitative finance concepts.

## Projects

1. [📈 Simulation Models](./simulation_models/README.md) ✅  
   Stochastic models including **Random Walk** and **Monte Carlo Simulation** for asset price modeling, risk analysis, and pricing strategies.

   🔭 **Planned Extensions:** ❌
   - Correlated random walks (multi-asset simulation)
   - Volatility clustering using GARCH and regime-switching models
   - Monte Carlo VaR estimation with tail risk scenarios
   - Parameter sensitivity analysis with walk-forward evaluation
   - Scenario generation for stress testing and backtest visualization  
   - Dashboard-style UI to interactively run simulations
