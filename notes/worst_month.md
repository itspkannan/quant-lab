# Worst month tech

To determine which month typically shows the worst performance for tech stocks, we can analyze the historical monthly returns of major tech-focused indices like the **Nasdaq-100** or sector ETFs such as **XLK** (Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund).

Historically, tech stocks tend to experience the worst performance in **September**:

### Why September is Notable:

* **Seasonal Weakness:** September has historically been a weak month for equities overall, and tech stocks tend to follow this trend.
* **Volatility:** Increased market volatility as institutional investors reposition portfolios after the summer.
* **Earnings Season Transition:** The absence of major earnings catalysts during September can contribute to lackluster performance.

### Example: Nasdaq-100 Historical September Returns

* **2021:** -5.7%
* **2022:** -10.5%
* **2023:** -6.2%

### What to Consider:

* While historical trends point to September as a weak month, market conditions, macroeconomic events, and earnings can heavily influence performance.
* It's crucial to diversify and adopt a long-term perspective when investing in volatile sectors like technology.
